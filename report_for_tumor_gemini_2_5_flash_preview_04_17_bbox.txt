Radiological Report:
Axial CT image of the brain demonstrates a well-defined, heterogeneous hyperdense lesion located in the right parietal lobe. The lesion measures approximately [estimated size, e.g., 3-4 cm in maximum dimension]. There is associated surrounding hypodensity, consistent with vasogenic edema. No significant midline shift is evident at this level. The appearance of this lesion, particularly the heterogeneous hyperdensity and surrounding edema, is highly suspicious for a mass lesion, which could represent a primary or secondary neoplasm, potentially with associated hemorrhage. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended for characterization.
