This is a ML (Machine Learning) based project on stroke detection capable of detecting strokes in MRI scans.

## Web-Based GUI

This project includes a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) to upload CT scans (in NIfTI format) and view stroke segmentations.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure the stroke detection model `stroke_segmentation_model_3d.h5` is present in the root directory of the project. This model can be generated by running `Stroke Code and Data/Main Code.py`.

### Running the Web Application
1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Start the Flask Server:**
    Run the `app.py` script from the root directory:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will typically start a development server, and the output will indicate the address where the application is running (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).

### Using the GUI
1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided when you started the server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
2.  Use the file upload form to select a NIfTI file (`.nii`) containing a CT scan.
3.  Click "Upload and Analyze".
4.  The page will refresh to show the original CT scan slice and the segmented stroke area if detected. An appropriate layer from the 3D scan will be chosen for display.
